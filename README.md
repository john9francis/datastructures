There are several types of datastructures used in computer programming to store data. The most commonly known data structure is the list:
```python
my_list = [1,2,3]
```
However, there are many other structures including stack, queue, set, linked list, and tree, to name a few. Each data structure has it's own uses. Each has highest performance for it's specific situation. 

In this tutorial I will be going over the following data structures:

* [Stack](#stack)
* [Set](#set)
* [Tree](#tree)

## Stack
### Introduction
Imagine a stack of pancakes. 
### Adding to a stack
```python
my_stack.append('item one')
```
### Getting info from a stack
```python
my_stack.pop()
```
### Performance

### Example

### Problem to solve

## Set 

## Tree
