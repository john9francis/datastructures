There are several types of datastructures used in computer programming to store data. The most commonly known data structure is the list:
```python
my_list = [1,2,3]
```
However, there are many other structures including stack, queue, set, linked list, and tree, to name a few. Each data structure has it's own uses. Each has highest performance for it's specific situation. 

In this tutorial I will be going over the following data structures:

* [Stack](#stack)
* [Set](#set)
* [Tree](#tree)

## Stack
### Introduction
Imagine you're making pancakes for breakfast. As you take each hot pancake off the pan, you place them on top of one another on a stack. Let's say you make 3 pancakes: first, you made pancake 1, then pancake 2, and finally pancake 3, placing them on the stack as you make them. Which pancake get's eaten first?

The pancake at the top of the stack, or the newest pancake (pancake 3) is eaten first. Then pancake 2 is eaten, and finally pancake 1 is eaten. The pancakes are eaten in the opposite order than the order they were placed in the stack.

in programming, a stack follows the same principle. 

### Adding to a stack
```python
my_stack.append('item one')
```
### Getting info from a stack
```python
my_stack.pop()
```
### Performance
